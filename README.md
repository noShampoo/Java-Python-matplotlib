Use Java to call Python to draw multiple line charts for data analysis
The general idea of this process is as follows:
1.Create the data you need to draw a line chart
2. Process the source data in Java. The data is placed in a List and merged into a List. Note that the length of your first list needs to be placed last.
3. Execute the python file through exec, that is, through the cmd command line
4, the Python file needs to get the list parameters from Java for conversion. Convert a javad list into two python lists. (The specific implementation can be seen in the source code)
5. Python plots through matplotlib.
